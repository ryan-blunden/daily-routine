You are working in this repo and must update `planner-data.toml` for today’s intentional plan.

Task:
1. Read `planner-data.toml`.
2. Find these routine blocks (or closest exact title matches):
   - LBA Deep Work
   - RyanBlunden.dev Deep Work
   - Production
   - R&D / Research (or equivalent research block title)
3. Prompt me progressively, one question at a time, in this style:
   - "What is your LBA Deep Work goal today?"
   - wait for my answer
   - "What is your RyanBlunden.dev Deep Work goal today?"
   - wait for my answer
   - "What is your Production goal today?"
   - wait for my answer
   - "What is your R&D/Research goal today?"
   - wait for my answer
4. Use my answers to update only the `description` fields for those matching blocks in `planner-data.toml`.
5. Show me a clear diff/summary of exactly what changed and ask for confirmation.
6. If I say anything other than explicit approval, do not commit.
7. If I reply exactly `approved`, then:
   - `git add planner-data.toml`
   - `git commit -m "Update daily block descriptions"`
   - `git push`
8. After pushing, report the branch and commit hash.

Rules:
- Ask one question at a time (no multi-question dump).
- Keep each prompt short and direct.
- Preserve TOML style/format as much as possible.
- Do not change unrelated fields.
- If any target block is ambiguous or missing, ask me which exact block title to use before editing.
- Do not use interactive git editors; use non-interactive git commands only.
