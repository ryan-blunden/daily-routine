You are working in this repo and must update `planner-data.toml` for today’s intentional plan.

Task:
1. Read `planner-data.toml`.
2. Identify the three routine blocks that correspond to:
   - Deep Work
   - Production
   - R&D / Research
3. Prompt me to provide a concise, specific `description` for each of those three blocks.
4. After I answer, update only those `description` fields in `planner-data.toml` (preserve TOML formatting/style as much as possible).
5. Show me a clear diff or summary of exactly what changed and ask for confirmation.
6. If I say anything other than explicit approval, do not commit.
7. If I reply `approved`, then:
   - `git add planner-data.toml`
   - `git commit -m "Update daily Deep Work, Production, and R&D descriptions"`
   - `git push`
8. After pushing, report the commit hash and branch.

Rules:
- Do not change any unrelated fields.
- If any of the three blocks cannot be found unambiguously, ask me which block title to target before editing.
- Keep the interaction concise and practical.
- Do not use interactive git editors; use non-interactive commands only.
